# openapi-inline-html

Generate standalone HTML from OpenAPI Specification. ðŸ“—âœ¨

## Feature

One of the key benefits of `openapi-inline-html` is its portability.
By generating a single, self-contained HTML file, all required assets (CSS, JavaScript, and OpenAPI data) are embedded directly in the document.
This makes it easy to:

1. **Share** : the file as a single, standalone document without additional dependencies.
2. **Hosting** : the file on any server or serve it locally, with no need for additional resources or configurations.
3. **Distribute** : the file via email or other methods, knowing that it will display consistently across environments.

This portability makes `openapi-inline-html` ideal for situations where reliable, standalone documentation is required.

## How to use

```bash
npx openapi-inline-html -i openapi.json
```

Use Dark theme ðŸŒ™

```bash
npx openapi-inline-html -i openapi.json --theme=dark
```
